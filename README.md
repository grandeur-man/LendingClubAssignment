## Group Members

- Sofianne Amarouche (Did not contribute)

## Conclusions
- Higher interest rate borrowers are more likely to default than low and moderate interest rate borrowers
- Shorter term loans are more likely to be fully paid than longer term loans
- Grade A borrowers are most likely to pay than their grade C&D counterparts who are more likely to default on loan payment.
- The likelihood to default on a loan increases with increasing loan amount. Hence smaller loans amounts are more likely to be fully paid.
